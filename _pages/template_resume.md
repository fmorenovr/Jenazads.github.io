About
======

I am a Artificial Intelligence Engineer in the Escola de Matemática Aplicada (EMAp) at the Fundação Getúlio Vargas (FGV), my research lies at the intersection of **Urban Perception**, **Deep Learning**, and **Interpretability Machine Learning**. I am especially interested in building efficient, and robust models that can perform analyzing, and understanding human perception from street images with or without associated description text to improve the identification of the visual components, and main perceptual features extraction for applications in urban computing. I'm also a back-end developer very passionate about Python, Golang, and DevOps. [[CV]](/pdf/CV.pdf)

Carrer summary
======

* Working in the "Evidence-based Monitoring and Prediction for Sustainable Forest Management" project to build evidence-based tools to analyze the Amazon rainforest deforestation and degradation.
* Worked on topics related to **fault prognostics** and developing tools to improve **fault detection and diagnostics** in the **industrial context** using probabilistic and AI models;
* **core competency** in data analytics, software engineering, real-time predictive algorithms, and incremental learning systems.
* received **two scholarships** to study new learning mechanisms in AI for fault detection and diagnostics in electrical systems, with one of them to **study in the USA** for a year;
* 8 **reviewed publications**, including 2 in a top-tier journal, 7 in national and international conferences/workshops, 2 under review and 2 in progress, **Young Author Support** awardee at IFAC'20;
* developed object-oriented **python web services** for Silicon Valley companies, worked under **Scrum management** to meet tight deadlines;
* Advanced level of English **(CEFR C1)** certified by the British Council. [[PDF Certificate]](/pdf/english.pdf)
* Tech stack: Python, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Django, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS (EC2, ELB, ECS, RDS, S3), Travis, Elasticsearch, MATLAB, C++, Node-red, MQTT, GIT.
