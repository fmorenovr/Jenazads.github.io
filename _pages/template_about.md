I am a Research Assistant in the [Escola de Matemática Aplicada (EMAp)](https://emap.fgv.br/) at the [Fundação Getúlio Vargas (FGV)](https://portal.fgv.br/), while also working as a part-time R&D engineer at a startup (Didius) and as a teaching assistant at my university. 

My research lies at the intersection of **Urban Perception**, **Deep Learning**, and **Interpretability Machine Learning**. I am especially interested in building efficient, and robust models that can perform analyzing, and understanding human perception from street images with or without associated description text to improve the identification of the visual components, and main perceptual features extraction for applications in urban computing.

## About me

I am doing a M.Sc. in Computer Science from the [Centro de Investigación e Innovación en Ciencia de la Computación (RICS)](http://rics.ucsp.edu.pe/) in the [Programa de Maestría en Ciencia de la Computación](http://rics.ucsp.edu.pe/mcs/index.html) at the [Universidad Católica San Pablo (UCSP)](http://ucsp.edu.pe/) with the [CONCYTEC](https://portal.concytec.gob.pe/) scholarship, Arequipa, PERU (2018-2020), and a B.Sc. in Computer Science from the [Facultad de Ciencias (FC)](https://fc.uni.edu.pe/fc/) in the [Escuela Profesional de Ciencia de la Computación (EPCC)](https://fc.uni.edu.pe/fc/index.php/escuelas/ciencia-de-la-computacion) at the [Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería (UNI)](https://www.uni.edu.pe/), Lima, PERU (2012-2017).

Furthermore, I have worked as Research Assistant in the [Big Data & HPC Lab](https://www.ctic.uni.edu.pe/index.php/laboratorios/bigdata-hpc) at the [Centro de Tecnologías y Comunicaciones (CTIC)](https://www.ctic.uni.edu.pe/) in fields like **Big Data**, **High-Performance Computing**, and **Fog Computing**. Also, as a part of my professional life, I have worked in [CERNICALO S.A.](http://cernicalo.net/) as a Web Development Engineer in 2017 and [ARIOT S.A.C.](https://ariot.pe/) as Software Engineer in 2018. In addition, I am a current Professional Fellow at [The Royal Academy of Engineering (RAEng)](https://www.raeng.org.uk/), London, UK since 2018.
