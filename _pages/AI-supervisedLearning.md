# Supervised Learning

**Supervised Learning** is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs.  
In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal).  

A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples.  
In Supervised Learning, All data is labeled and the algorithms learn to predict the output from the input data.  

Is divided in two models:

* Regression: Predict continuous values

* Classification: Predict discrete(categorical) values
