abstract: "Currently in Peru, people prefer to live in apartment instead of houses but in some cases there are troubles with belongings between tenants who leave their stuffs in parking lots. For that, the use of an intelligent mobile mini-robot is proposed to implement a monitoring system of objects, such as cars in an underground garage inside a building using deep learning models in order to solve problems of theft of belongings. In addition, the small robot presents an indoor location system through the use of beacons that allow us to identify the position of the parking lot corresponding to each tenant of the building during the route of the robot."
