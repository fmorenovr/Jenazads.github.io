Abstract:

In this article we present a study on how much the learning speed differs and how much information retention capacity children between 6 to 9 years old, adolescents between 10 to 13 years old, young people between 14 to 17 years old and adults from 18 years old Who have in the same conditions of learning, same environment, same classes, same tools and the same methodology, such as mental maps, computational thinking and scripting language questions with the aim of learning concepts about algorithms, objects and classes applied to create robots, IoT concepts and Electronic hardware concepts through different online platforms using Block Programming. In addition, the way in which the learning curve is measured is evaluating the ability to retain, a skill gained and how much they have learned during the course of a certain time, also the methodology that they use to solve problems.
