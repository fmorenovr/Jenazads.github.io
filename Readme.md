=====================

This is my website developed on jekyll and ruby.

You can see the documentation about [jekyll][jekyll-home] or [github pages][github-pages].

You can take this web like a demo that was created by [Jenazads][jen-profile] and see how configure your own jekyll website on [your localhost][jekyll-localhost].

Users are free to copy and re-use any and all of the code contained here without contact with me.
