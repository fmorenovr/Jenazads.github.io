abstract: "Block programming presents an interactive and very simple way to learn to program, today block programming applications allow you to develop and program the electronic hardware components such as sensors and motors, whose relationship between hardware, software and mobile applications are fundamental in this technological age. In this article, we present a study on how much the speed of learning differs and how much information retention capacity children, adolescents, and adults have in the same conditions of learning, environment, tools and teaching system with the topic of creating robots through simulation of electronic circuits. In addition, the manipulation of electronic components such as sensors, motors, and Bluetooth is presented."
