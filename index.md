I am a Research Assistant in the Escola de Matemática Aplicada (EMAp) at the Fundação Getúlio Vargas (FGV), my research lies at the intersection of **Urban Perception**, **Deep Learning**, and **Interpretability Machine Learning**. I am especially interested in building efficient, and robust models that can perform analyzing, and understanding human perception from street images with or without associated description text to improve the identification of the visual components, and main perceptual features extraction for applications in urban computing.
