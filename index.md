About
======

I am a __Artificial Intelligence Engineer__ in the Escola de Matemática Aplicada (EMAp) at the Fundação Getúlio Vargas (FGV), my research lies at the intersection of **Urban Perception**, **Deep Learning**, and **Interpretability Machine Learning**. I am especially interested in building efficient, and robust models that can perform analyzing, and understanding human perception from street images with or without associated description text to improve the identification of the visual components, and main perceptual features extraction for applications in urban computing. I'm also a back-end developer very passionate about Python, Golang, and DevOps.

Employment

**[Fundação Getúlio Vargas (EMAp)](https://emap.fgv.br/)** <span style="float:right">Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</span>  
*Data Scientist* <span style="float:right">May 2019 - Current</span>

* My work relies in two main projects: (i) **Timberflow**: It is focused on detecting illegal timber operations in the Amazon Rainforest; (ii) **Urban safety Perception**(UrbEX): Analyse criminal data and urban perception on street images. For a better organization, teams organized [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum) ceremonies to increase developer engagement in all projects.

* TimberFlow: I integrated two major Brazilian databases (Sinaflor and Sisflora) of wood-based product transportation/exportation. Using libraries like Pandas and Selenium, my work helps to automate the process of cleaning, filter, and unifying both datasets, resulting in a very simple and organized database ([link to reference](https://www.google.com)).  

* Urban Safety Perception: Analyzing street view images, we extract main features from them to map zones with criminal rate records. We use several techniques based on object segmentation (DeepLabv3+), object detection (Faster-RCNN), and GANs. As main results, we can correlate and understand why streets could be safely perceived ([link to reference](https://www.google.com)).
