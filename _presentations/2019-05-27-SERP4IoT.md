Abstract:

In the current years, IoT has evolved to such an extent to extend to all corners of each place through devices, which connected to a network, either local or internet itself, generate information to be processed with a specific purpose, to this level there is a problem called interoperability of devices where not only is the compatibility of adding or removing devices to an ecosystem and there is compatibility, it is also expected that the information generated is standardized and optimized to transmit. This paper presents a new software architecture pattern for interoperability between devices that generate heterogeneous information in the edge layer of an IoT ecosystem.
