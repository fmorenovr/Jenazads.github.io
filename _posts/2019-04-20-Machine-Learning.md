## Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a scientific discipline in the field of Artificial Intelligence that creates systems that learn automatically.  
"Learning" in this context means identifying complex patterns in millions of data.  
What the machine really learns is an algorithm that reviews the data and is able to predict or describe future behaviors.

Example:



* Task:

* Performance:

* Experience: 

### Supervised Learning

This method is based on the term `Conceptual Learning`, in other words, the learning process is to find a way to relationate organized data.

### Semi-Supervised Learning

This method is based on the term `Inductive Learning`, in other words, the learning process is to find a way to relationate a bit quantity of organized data to generalize it in large quantity of unorganized data.

### Similarity Learning

This method is based on the term `Compare Learning`, in other words, the learning process is to find from previously organized data a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are.

### Unsupervised Learning

This method is based on the term `Shapes Organized Learning`, in other words, the learning process is to find a way to relationate patterns and characteristics of unorganized data.

### Active Learning

This method is based on the term `Query-Answer Learning`, in other words, the learning process depends of the interaction between users and query website to get more data from them.

### Reinforcement Learning

### Transfer Learning

### Meta-Learning
