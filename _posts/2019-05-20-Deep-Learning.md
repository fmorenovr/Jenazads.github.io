# Deep Learning

## Deep Learning vs Machine Learning

## Deep Learning Types

### Reinforcement Learning

This type is based on the term `Reinforcement Learning`, in other words, the learning process is to maximize the reward obtained from every scenario modelated from data.

See main article [Reinforcement Learning](/dl/reinforcement_learning).

### Transfer Learning

This type is based on the term `Experienced Learning`, in other words, the learning process is take a previous learned parameters from some date and start new learning process using the target data.

See main article [Transfer Learning](/dl/transfer_learning).

### Meta-Learning

This type is based on the term `Autodidact Learning`, in other words, the learning process is to understand how to solve learning problems with greater flexibility, improving the performance of existing algorithms or inducing the learning algorithm itself.

See main article [Meta-Learning](/dl/meta_learning).

## Deep Learning Models/Algorithms

There is a different models or approach those define algorithms based on mathematics, statistics and matrix models in deep learning.

### Unsupervised Pretrained Networks

See main article [UPN](/dl/unsupervised_petrained_networks).

### Recursive Neural Networks

Is the model based on ANN and tree data structures to solve more complex problems.

See main article [RcNN](/dl/recursive_networks).

### Recurrent Neural Networks

Is the model based on ANN to solve more complex problems.

See main article [RNN](/dl/recurrent_networks).

### Convolutional Neural Networks

Is the model based on ANN to solve complex problems which depends of data extracted from images.

See main article [CNN](/dl/convolutional_networks).
