# Deep Learning

## Deep Learning vs Machine Learning

## Deep Learning Types

## Deep Learning Models/Algorithms

There is a different models or approach those define algorithms based on mathematics, statistics and matrix models in deep learning.

### Unsupervised Pretrained Networks

See main article [UPN](/dl/unsupervised_petrained_networks).

### Convolutional Neural Networks

Is the model based on ANN to solve complex problems which depends of data extracted from images.

See main article [CNN](/dl/convolutional_networks).
