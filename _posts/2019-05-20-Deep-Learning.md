Describing Deep Learning Types and Algorithms

# Deep Learning

## Deep Learning vs Machine Learning

Deep Learning is a subtype of Machine Learning focus on Images as data.

  |  | Machine Learning | Deep Learning |
  :---------:|:---:|:-----:
   How does it work?  | Use types of automated algrithms which learn to predict future decisions and model function using the data fed to it. | Interprets data features and its relationships using neural networks which pass the relevant information through several stages of data processing. 
   Management | The various algorithms are directed by the analysis to examine the different variables in the dataset | Once they are implemented, the algorithms are usually self-directed for the relevant data analysis 
   Number of Data Points  | Usually, there are a gew thousand data points used for the analysis. | There a few million data points used for the analysis. 
   Output | The output is usually a numerical value, like a score or a classification | The output can be anything from a score, an element, free text or sound, etc. 

## Deep Learning Types

### Transfer Learning

This type is based on the term `Experience based Learning`, in other words, the learning process is take a previous learned parameters from some pre-trained model and start new learning process using the target data.

See main article [Transfer Learning](/dl/transfer_learning).

## Deep Learning Models/Algorithms

There is a different models or approach those define algorithms based on mathematics, statistics and matrix models in deep learning.

### Unsupervised Pretrained Networks

See main article [UPN](/dl/unsupervised_petrained_networks).

### Recursive Neural Networks

Is the model based on ANN and tree data structures to solve more complex problems.

See main article [RcNN](/dl/recursive_networks).

### Recurrent Neural Networks

Is the model based on ANN to solve more complex problems.

See main article [RNN](/dl/recurrent_networks).

### Convolutional Neural Networks

Is the model based on ANN to solve complex problems which depends of data extracted from images.

See main article [CNN](/dl/convolutional_networks).
