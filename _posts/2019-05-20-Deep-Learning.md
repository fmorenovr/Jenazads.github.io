# Deep Learning

## Deep Learning vs Machine Learning

## Deep Learning Types

### Reinforcement Learning

This type is based on the term `Reinforcement Learning`, in other words, the learning process is to maximize the reward obtained from every scenario modelated from data.

See main article [Reinforcement Learning](/ml/reinforcement_learning).

## Deep Learning Models/Algorithms

There is a different models or approach those define algorithms based on mathematics, statistics and matrix models in deep learning.

### Unsupervised Pretrained Networks

See main article [UPN](/ml/unsupervised_petrained_networks).

### Recursive Neural Networks

Is the model based on ANN and tree data structures to solve more complex problems.

See main article [RsNN](/ml/recursive_networks).

### Recurrent Neural Networks

Is the model based on ANN to solve more complex problems.

See main article [RNN](/ml/recurrent_networks).

### Convolutional Neural Networks

Is the model based on ANN to solve complex problems which depends of data extracted from images.

See main article [CNN](/ml/convolutional_networks).
