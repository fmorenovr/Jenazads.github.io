## Android Studio

Android Studio is an IDE to develop android OS applications.

### Requeriments

* Java: Try with java-8

      sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
      sudo apt-get update
      sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
      sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-set-default

* Then, some libraries of 32bits:

      sudo apt-get install lib32z1 lib32ncurses5 lib32bz2-1.0 lib32stdc++6

* Android Studio, go to [android download website](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) and download it.

* Once downloaded, run these commands:

      unzip android-studio-ide-171.4443003-linux.zip
      cd android-studio/bin

* Android Studio it starts and it'll download some main components.  
  This take a few minutes.

  ![download](/assets/IDEs/AndroidStudio/android-components.png)

* Once download, you should go to SDK Manager and download API components.  
  An API component is a version of Android (for instance, android 4.4).  
  Choose your version and download it.

* Finally, you can start new project using the API that you downloaded.  
  Have fun :D

## Android Shell

Is a method that you can connect with your smartphone using SSH connection (through a bash shell).

* First, list a usb devices:

      lsusb
      
  ![lsusb](/assets/systemCommand/adb/lsusb.png)

    Here, you can see my motorola device with Id `22b8`.
    
* Second, install android-tools:

      sudo apt-get install android-tools-adb

* Third, Creates a file in `/etc/udev/rules.d/` with name `51-android.rules`:

      sudo touch etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules 
      sudo nano etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules 
      
  And add:
  
      SUBSYSTEM=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="22b8", OWNER="jenazad" GROUP="jenazad" 

  Where `idVendor` is the id of my device, `OWNER` and `GROUP` is the user permissions.
  
* Fourth, restart udev service:

      sudo services udev restart

* Fifth, check for devices:

      adb devices

  ![devices](/assets/systemCommand/adb/devices.png)

* Sixth, connect with your mobile:

      adb shell
      
  During the process, your mobile will receive a notification to connect through ssh like:
  
  ![notify](/assets/systemCommand/adb/mobile-shell.png)
  
  Accept, and now you can manage your data through shell.
