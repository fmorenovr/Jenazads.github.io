# GNOME Polari

For this guide, I use my Fedora Workstation 25 Virtual Machine installed on my localhost using virt-manager, you can see how download and install pressing [here][vm-url].

* This application is a minimal IRC client. It is designed to distill the IRC experience down to a super-simple interface. It also uses the GNOME telepathy backend, and allows you to reply to chat messages straight from the notifications.  
Then, install:

      sudo dnf install polari

Polari is an exclusive IRC Client that is the big difference with [empathy][empathy-url].

## Testing

Once installed, you'll have this window:  
You can see your chats (previously we use Empathy, so appears a list of created chats).  

![pol_init][polari-init]

If you press plus button, you can add net and choose your chat room.  

![pol_new][polari-new-chat]

You can see your chats (previously we use Empathy, so appears a list of created chats). Then, you can choose your chat and connect.  

![pol-chats][polari-chats]

## Functionalities

* IRC Client chat
* Search for Id user and autocomplete to talk
* Send Images and text messages.
