abstract="Moreno-Motta, JuanMoreno-Vera, FelipeMoreno, Frank A.Currently, IoT has evolved to such an extent to extend to all corners of each place through devices that are connected to a network and generate information. In most cases, to be processed for a specific purpose or storage as historical data, an IoT ecosystem is implemented to manage those tasks between different devices, frameworks, or applications. Besides, more complex IoT ecosystems require more complex architecture to manage the information flow; at this level, we found a problem called interoperability. This problem is not limited to the compatibility of adding/removing devices to an ecosystem; it is also expected that the information generated by devices and processed complies with a standard optimizing the data transmission. In this work, we present a new software architecture pattern to avoid the problem of interoperability through the process of exchange information between devices and prevent and store heterogeneous information coming from different layers of an IoT ecosystem.",
