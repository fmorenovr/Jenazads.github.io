# UnSupervised Learning

**UnSupervised Learning** is the machine learning task of learning without a teacher and a method of modelling the probability density of inputs.  
In unsupervised learning, each example is an input object (typically a vector) treated as a set of random variables, with a density model being constructed for the data set.  

A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples.  
In UnSupervised Learning, All data is unlabeled and the algorithms learn to inherent structure from the input data.  

Is divided in two classes:

* Clustering: Find a way to automatically group data based on similarities or related with some variables.

* Non-Clustering: (Association/Dimensional Reduction) Find structures/patterns from all data.
